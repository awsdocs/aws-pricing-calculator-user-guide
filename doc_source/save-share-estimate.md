# Sharing your estimate<a name="save-share-estimate"></a>

You can create a unique, public link for each estimate that you create\. Use this link to share the estimate with stakeholders or access the estimate again at a later time\. Estimates are saved to AWS public servers\.

Any changes you make to an estimate requires you to save again\. AWS Pricing Calculator doesn't automatically save to the same link to prevent unwanted overwrites\. Alternatively, you can use the shared link as a template for common use cases, and use it as a starting point to build complex estimates\.

**Note**  
Make sure that you save your generated links because your estimates can't be accessed without them\.  
Generated links are not auto\-saved with updates\. If you make changes to an estimate, you must generate a new sharable link\.  
Public share links expire after three years\.

## Creating an estimate link<a name="create-estimate-link"></a>

To create an estimate and share the results, generate a share link\.<a name="create-share-link"></a>

**To create your public share link**

1. Open AWS Pricing Calculator at [https://calculator\.aws/\#/](https://calculator.aws/#/)\.

1. Create an estimate by adding one or more services\. For more information, see [Create an estimate, configure a service, add more services, edit your inputs, and generate bulk estimates](create-estimate.md)\.

1. Open the **My estimate** page at [https://calculator\.aws/\#/estimate](https://calculator.aws/#/estimate) \.

1. Choose **Share**\.

1. Read the **Public server acknowledgment** and choose **Agree and Continue**\.

   \(Optional\) You can select **Don't show me this again** for future visits\.

1. Choose **Copy public link** to copy your generated link\.

We recommend you document your shared links with a brief description of the estimate\.

## Creating a new link for updated estimates<a name="update-estimate-link"></a>

If you update an existing estimate, you must save the changes and regenerate a share link\.<a name="update-estimate-link-steps"></a>

**To update your estimate and generate a new link**

1. To open your saved estimate, copy your unique link into your browser's navigation bar\.

1. From the **Estimate** page, find the service that you want to modify and choose the **Edit** icon\.

1. Make your changes and choose **Save** to return to the **Estimate** page\.

1. Choose **Share** to generate a link to the estimate\.

The changes made aren't saved to the original shared link, so you can return to the original link as needed\.
