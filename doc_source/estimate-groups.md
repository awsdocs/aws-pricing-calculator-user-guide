# Using groups to organize your estimates<a name="estimate-groups"></a>

You can organize your AWS estimates by defining groups\. A group can reflect how your company is organized, such as by providing estimates by cost center\. Otherwise, it can reflect other organization methods, such as by product stack or product architecture\. For example, assume that you want to price out different ways to build your AWS setup\. You can use different groups for each variation of your setup and compare the estimates for the different setups\. You can also generate one estimate for how much running a website might cost you,\. Then, you can generate another estimate for how much running a machine learning process might cost\. By doing this, you can see the combined estimate for your AWS usage\.

Groups are also useful to compare AWS Regions\. By creating a group for each Region, you can compare the cost to run servers in two different locations\. For example, you can generate an estimate for US East \(N\. Virginia\) in one group and Asia Pacific \(Seoul\) for another\. Then, you can compare your two estimates to meet your specific use case and budget\.
