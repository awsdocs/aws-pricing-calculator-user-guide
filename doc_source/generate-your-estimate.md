# Generating your estimate<a name="generate-your-estimate"></a>

You can add a service directly to your estimate or to one or more groups to get an estimate for that service\.

To generate an estimate, create an estimate and add services or groups and services to your estimate\. AWS Pricing Calculator provides you with multiple estimates, including the cost estimate for your entire estimate or the cost estimates any of the individual groups in your estimate\.

Groups are optional but useful\. They enable you to add multiple Regions to your estimate or organize your estimate in many ways such as by cost center, team, or product\.

**Note**  
AWS provides a free tier that enables you to try some AWS services for free\. The free tier covers only certain instances or usage and for only a limited amount of time\. AWS Pricing Calculator includes non\-expiring free tiers by default, but assumes that you aren't using the free tier and doesn't include any expiring free tiers in your estimate\.
