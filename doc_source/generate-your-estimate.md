# Best practice for generating estimates<a name="generate-your-estimate"></a>

This chapter outlines some best practices for generating your AWS Pricing Calculator estimates\.

To get the most out of your estimates, make sure you have a good understanding of your base requirements\. For example, if you're going to try Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\), we recommended that you know what kind of operating system you need, what your memory requirements are, and how much I/O you need\. Before you begin, determine whether you need storage\. For example, decide if you will run a database and how long you intend to use the servers that you will need\. You can use the AWS Pricing Calculator service configuration and parameters to see which option meets your specific use case and budget\.

When you generate your estimates, it's recommended you consider the following:
+ How do you want to organize your estimates?
+ Do you want to add an AWS Support plan?
+ Will you need to access your estimates at a later time?
