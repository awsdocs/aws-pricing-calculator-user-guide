## Using the AWS Pricing Calculator console<a name="using-apc-console"></a>

The AWS Pricing Calculator consists of four major console pages\.

**Landing page**  
This page links to key resources\. For example, this user guide, [ FAQs](http://aws.amazon.com/calculator/calculator-faq/), and [pricing assumptions](http://aws.amazon.com/calculator/calculator-assumptions/)\.  
Direct link: [https://calculator\.aws/\#/](https://calculator.aws/#/) 

**Add Service page**  
You navigated to the **Add Service** page when you begin creating an estimate\. This page has calculators for all services that AWS Pricing Calculator supports\. There's a calculator for each service, and a single calculator supports multiple services in some use cases\. Use the search menu to enter service names or keywords\. You can also find more information about each service through the **Product page** links\.  
Direct link: [https://calculator\.aws/\#/addService](https://calculator.aws/#/addService) 

**Configure calculator page**  
Use the configure calculator page to enter your customized details for your service calculator\. Information includes a description \(optional\), choosing an AWS Region to create an estimate for, and other inputs for the service based on your use case\. View your estimate results and review the calculations behind each estimate\. You can add the estimate of your service to the **My estimates** page using the **Go to My Estimate** at the end of the page\. To add more services to your estimate, choose **Continue adding service**\.  
Direct link \(example\): [https://calculator\.aws/\#/createCalculator/Athena](https://calculator.aws/#/createCalculator/Athena)   
You can directly navigate to individual service calculators\.

**My estimate page**  
**Estimate summary** section: This section shows your estimates in **Upfront cost**, **Monthly cost**, and your **Total 12 months cost**\. The **total 12 months cost** is the sum of all estimates and groups\. It combines the upfront and monthly costs\. The upfront cost shows how much you're estimated to pay when you set up your services\. Monthly costs are how much you're estimated to spend for ongoing months\.  
**Groups** and **My estimate** section: This is your working section that shows a list of your service calculators\. You can add more services here, and use the search bar to enter keywords to find your previous service estimates\.  
On this page, you can export your estimates to CSV or PDF files, share your estimate links, and navigate to the AWS console to sign in or create an account\.

AWS provides the Free Tier that you can use to try some AWS services for free\. The Free Tier only covers certain instances or usage for a limited amount of time\. Free Tier isn't included in your AWS Pricing Calculator estimates unless it's specifically called out otherwise\. AWS Pricing Calculator assumes that you aren't using the Free Tier and doesn't include any expiring Free Tier in your estimates\.
